**RagsToRoyaltRP**

**Discord Rules:**

**1.** Do not @ the owner regarding general information that is readily available via an
announcement or within the rules. While directing questions/concerns to the owner in
stream may be what you’re used to, please understand that this is a functioning server
dedicated specifically to the city. Your concerns/questions need to be addressed by opening a
support ticket and allowing the moderators and admin staff to handle the situation before
bringing it to the owners.
**2.** Do NOT direct message the owner, admin staff, or moderators for personal/RP reasons.
All support tickets are logged whereas private DMs are not; we cannot monitor what is being
said or discussed if done via DMs. If you have a concern, please open a support ticket. If you
have a PC related question, we have a PC Builds channel located in discord. Repetitive
messaging the owner or staff may result in disciplinary action.
**3.** Do NOT add the owner, admin, or mod staff unless they are the ones to initiate the
request. Under no circumstances should this privilege be abused and used to your personal
advantage regarding in city information/issues.
**4.** We are an 18+ server, serious RP server. We’re a “new-to-RP” friendly server ; please ensure
that you have read and understand both the discord rules and in city rules before applying for
a whitelist.
**5.** Whitelist applications will be reviewed thoroughly. If your application was denied with reason,
you must submit an entirely new application. We are unable to review any edits made to the
previously denied version. If you have questions regarding the reason why it was denied, you
will need to open a support ticket. Staff is also able to provide your previous acceptable
responses to the other questions if requested. If your application is denied a second time, you
will be advised to open a support ticket so that we may review the responses one on one with
you.
**6.** All interactions within the discord chat must be conducted in a respectful manner. Mods
and staff are available intermittently throughout the day, but if there is an interaction that
transpires in any sort of chat that you feel the staff needs to see and you are unsure if it has
been addressed, please feel free to @ someone in staff. Do not use this time to @ the
owner.
**7.** There will be no racial, sexual, religious, or political based opinions allowed .
**8.** Please understand regardless of your relationship with any Owners, staff members, or content
creators within the city, this will not grant you any type of special treatment. Everyone will be
held to the same standards and will be expected to abide by the rules as they are outlined
here. Donating to the community does not grant you any type of immunity or special
consideration; Owners and staff pride themselves on keeping a fair and unbiased community.
Please be respectful of the time, money, and hard work that has gone into creating this city
and community by following the rules we’ve set in place.
**9.** You are a part of RagsToRichesRP now; we are family. If at any point you feel uncomfortable,
concerned, or even have a suggestion on what to add to the city then please feel free to reach
out to staff via the suggestions channel and/or a support ticket.
**10.** If you have an issue with someone within the staff, please open a support ticket. If you are
uncomfortable reaching out while they are present, you may DM a member of the admin team
(NOT THE OWNER) and inform them of your request. It will then go through approval with the
owners to see if a smaller team can be assembled to investigate your concerns.
11. Under no circumstances will a member be allowed to retaliate/disrespect someone in the city
because of the role they may hold within discord. If you feel as if a staff member has violated
this rule, please refer to rule #10 for further instructions.


**In City Rules:**

**A working, functional mic is required.**

**○ Making a character:**
○ Names: Realistic names only; if you can google it and find a history of the name, it will
be accepted. No “trickster” names will be accepted, or street names (Ex: Ben Dover or
Lil Ty). You may go by a nickname within the city, but your gov’t name must be
realistic and this is how you must introduce yourself to gov’t authorities within the
city.
**○ Gov’t:** Suffixes, hyphenated names, and any special characters (commas, periods, etc)
will not be accepted; unfortunately this makes it difficult for the city government to
find you within the system.
**○ Alternate Characters:** If you have more than one character, please remember that your
characters are not related (aka “cousins”) and information or relationships between
the characters should never intertwine. This would be a form of meta-gaming and will
be subject to disciplinary action.
Power Gaming-Exploiting-Cheating:
**○ Using any game modifications, programs, or enhancements that may give a player an
unfair advantage (We have an anti-cheat).**
**○ Exploiting server bugs is prohibited.** All server bugs should be reported in the
appropriate bugs channel or via support ticket.
**❖** If you are in the fetal position, in handcuffs, on your back, or in any way
incapacitated– you should not be using your radio or phone.
**Meta-Gaming:**
○ Meta-gaming is the action of mixing in-character and out-of-character information.
You must only use the information that you learn while RPing your current character
and all that information/knowledge ceases to exist once you fly in as a separate
character.
**i. Ex:** Watching someone’s stream and you learn where a drug location is. Your
crim character then flies in and immediately finds the location.
**ii. Ex:** Your crim character is getting ready to raid an opposing gang’s facility. You
fly in as your PD character and inform high command of a potential raid.
**iii. Ex:** Being in a private phone call/discord call with another member whilst in the
city. All communications must happen IN CITY.
RDM-VDM-Combat Logging:
**○ Random Deathmatch (RDM):** The act of killing another member in the city without the
proper RP to justify the action.
**○ Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM):** The act of killing another member, or group of members,
with a vehicle without the proper RP to justify the action.
**○ Combat logging:** The act of purposefully leaving by closing the game during an RP
scene to avoid consequences (not to be confused with FiveM crashing).
**i.** If at any point your game crashes during an RP scene, please immediately notify
others via the discord channel and reconnect as soon as you are able. Also keep
in mind that admin staff can tell when you purposefully disconnect (F8 quit).
**DDOoSING-Doxxing-Internet Harassment:**
○ Any talk, discussion or threatening of/to sending or linking IP address, booting offline,
location finding, sending virus’, as well as spamming in OOC sky will result in a
perma-ban.
**Robbing-Taking Hostage:**
○ Law enforcement officers cannot be robbed!
○ Law enforcement officers may only be taken hostage when there are a minimum of 5
officers on duty (to check this, use your ‘home’ button and if you see 2 check marks
then you are clear to proceed).
○ You are not allowed to rob mechanics of their materials while they are at the recycling
station. They need these materials to repair vehicles.
○ Police cars may only be stolen during an active scene as a means to get away. You may
not steal items from the trunk or glove box!
○ If a hostage complies with your demands, you are unable to harm them intentionally.
○ Do not rob anyone while processing drugs; if you want to rob them, catch them before
or after they leave the building! You may rob them while they are harvesting!
○ EMS is to never be robbed for any reason!
○ Once you perform a house robbery, you are not to return to that house to finish
robbing once the police are lost.
**Value Your Life:**
○ You must value your life at all times, unless you outnumber them.
○ If someone has you at gunpoint (within 10 ft), you are not allowed to run away or
counter with your own weapon on foot. If you are in a vehicle and able to get away then
you may do so.
**○ NO SUICIDE RP ALLOWED.** If you logically would not survive that action IRL, then do
not do it in RP. Make sure you have the proper equipment in RP that would be needed
for the action IRL ex. Using a parachute when jumping out of an airplane.
Derogatory Words/Remarks/Actions:
○ There will be no racial, sexual, religious, or political based opinions allowed.
**Government Jobs:**
○ There is no such thing as a corrupt government within RagsToRiches.
○ Exploiting PD/EMS/Gov’t jobs by distributing items and giving them to
non-government employees will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action.
○ Absolutely no impersonation of a government employee; this will result in disciplinary
action within the city if caught.
**Green Zones:**
○ Green zones are considered as such: MRPD, Pillbox, Mechanic shops and Businesses!
○ You are not to begin any aggressive/hostile RP while within a green zone. If you are
attacked while within a green zone, continue to RP it out how you prefer, but do not
retaliate within the green zone.
○ There is a 15-minute cooldown period after someone leaves Pillbox Hospital or
Bolingbroke Penitentiary. During this time, no violent RP can be conducted towards
the individual who just left either of these locations.
○
○ If aggressive/hostile RP begins outside of the green zone, but is then carried into a
green zone then it may continue. Do not think that you can start a shoot out and flee
to MRPD and the RP will just stop instantaneously.
**Fail RP:**
○ The act in which your actions may break the immersion for another member.
○ Under no circumstance should you break character; if another member is breaking the
rules or doing something you don’t agree with then you will need to open a support
ticket with staff. Always remain in character and RP it out to the best of your abilities
even if that means making your character leave the scene or speaking to someone
different.
○ By disputing someone else’s RP, or storyline, just because you don’t agree with it is
fail RP. Do not ruin the immersion and storyline just because you don’t agree with
their actions.
i. EMS will become more active; do not fail RP by expecting them to just revive you
so that you can run off. Please allow EMS to explore their creativity to make the
interactions with other members more inclusive.
Music Within City:
○ All music that is played within the city must be non-copyright
(chopped/slowed/reverbed). Any member caught using copyright music will be
subject to disciplinary action.
**Server Restarts:**
○ No crime should begin within the 20 minutes prior to a server restart.
**Poaching:**
○ There will be absolutely zero tolerance for poaching within the city and discord. If
you are caught promoting another server within the city or discord channel, you will be
subject to removal.
**Additional Rules:**
○ Under no circumstance, while inside RagsToRiches Automotive, should any RP transpire
outside of verbal communication. You are there to purchase a vehicle and be on your
way.
○ You cannot ramp vehicles in this city. You also can only go off road with a vehicle thats
meant to go off road!
○ If you have your clothes stolen from you, you are not to /reloadskin until you get to a
clothing store. If seen reloading skin right after it will be auto 24 hour ban. This is
complete Fail RP!
